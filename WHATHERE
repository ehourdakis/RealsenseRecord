In this directory there are tools for recording from the realsense cameras.

Contains classes to process IMU:


- record_IMU_as_R:        Extract a rotation matrix and save it every time a new rgb d frame is available
- rs_async.cpp            Extract the frames (rgb, depth, imu acc, imu rot) and save them when available (no synchronization)
- rs_async_RGBDAccRotPair Extract frame with rgb, depth and the vector of imu accs and rots in between.
In this last one, gyro data are sampled on acceleration data (since gyro data are faster)

- rs_async_drop_RGBDIMU     Drop the IMUs from the device callback and get the timestamps. It needs the synchronization scripts in the python/tools directory or the data/Recorded directory
