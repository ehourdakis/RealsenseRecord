scripts that evaluate a dataset using the RGB-d tools provided that the tools are installed in /files/Projects/UnderDev/roboslam/tools/pythons/rgb-d tools


A typical command line is 


cls && > ../../../data/Recorded/Results/rgbd_out.txt && ./eval_rgbd.sh 1 1 "/files/Projects/UnderDev/roboslam/build/" 1 >> ../../../data/Recorded/Results/rgbd_out.txt 


where it cleans the output results + outputs the evaluation of the passed dir to clean rgbd_out.txt
