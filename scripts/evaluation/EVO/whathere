scripts that evaluate a dataset using the evo tools provided that evo is installed in the /home/manos/.local/bin


A typical command line is 


cls && > ../../../data/Recorded/Results/evo_out.txt && ./eval_evo.sh 1 1 "/files/Projects/UnderDev/roboslam/build/" -sa >> ../../../data/Recorded/Results/evo_out.txt 


where it cleans the output results + outputs the evaluation of the passed dir to clean evo_out.txt
